# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

For a modern and functional housekeeping management system like Upkeep, the color palette should reflect cleanliness, efficiency, and ease of use. Here's a recommended color palette:

1. **Primary Color (Accent):**  
   - **Teal Blue (#008080):** This gives a fresh, clean feel, symbolizing hygiene and trust, ideal for an application centered around housekeeping.

2. **Secondary Color (Supportive Highlights):**  
   - **Light Cyan (#E0FFFF):** A lighter shade to complement the primary teal blue. It works well for background highlights or accenting important information.

3. **Neutral Colors (Background & Text):**  
   - **Light Gray (#F2F2F2):** For background areas to ensure readability and create a clean look.
   - **Dark Charcoal (#333333):** For primary text, making it easy to read on light backgrounds.
   - **White (#FFFFFF):** For contrasts, creating space and a modern interface.

4. **Success Color (Indicating Action):**  
   - **Lime Green (#32CD32):** To represent successful actions like accepted requests or tasks completed.

5. **Alert Color (For Warnings or Errors):**  
   - **Coral Red (#FF6F61):** Used to draw attention to urgent tasks or errors in the app interface, such as missed cleaning times.

This palette balances a fresh, clean look with functional colors for status updates and interactions.
